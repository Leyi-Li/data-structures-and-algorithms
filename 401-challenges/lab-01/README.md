# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Without using any built-in methods, you need to reverse the array in place.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Given an array, reverse all the elements in the array in place.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I was thinking about using the middle point of the length and start to swap things from the middle however I found that it was not working so I changed my strategy to do it from the edge.
